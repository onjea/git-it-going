learning github

this is a practice exercise for learning how to use git hub. Creating a repository, with a read-me file, then creating a branch of the master, making changes to the branch and then committing the changes.

This read me file first includes instructions on using markdown.

**This text is bold** 

this should be a header
=======================

sweet, it worked. :P

*one asterisk creates italics*

let's add a link now:

[this is a link to Google!](http://google.com)

The text for the link is in square brackets, followed by the actual link in normal parentheses.

# h1 tag is created with one hashtag followed by a SPACE! This is the biggest header.
## h2 with 2 hashtags
### h3 with 3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6 is the smallest header size

_surrounding text with an underscore at the beginning and the end is another way to italicize text._

__surrounding text with double underscores is another way to make text bold.__

* unordered list is created with one asterisk followed by a space.
* this is an unordered list
  * tab to create an indented list line and makes the bullet fill white
    * the third indentation turns the bullet into a square
      * and then further indentation are always squares.
